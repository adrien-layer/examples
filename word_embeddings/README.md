# What is Layer?
Layer is a [Declarative MLOps Platform](https://layer.co/) that empowers Data Science teams to implement end-to-end machine learning with minimal effort. Layer is a managed solution and can be used without the hassle involved in configuring and setting up servers. 


# Getting started
This project illustrates how to train a natural language process model in Layer using pre-trained word embeddings.
Let's start by installing Layer:
```
pip install layer-sdk
```

Clone this  natural language processing with Layer project:
```
layer clone https://github.com/layerml/word_embeddings
```
Change into the word embeddings folder run the project:
```
cd word_embeddings
layer start

```
